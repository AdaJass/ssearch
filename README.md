Ssearch is a chatable search website

# Installation
If you want to run this web server on your cp. you need to preinstall nodejs and mongodb. I assume your computer has met it. And then, clone this repository to your computer, run a command line switch to its directory. and then type:
```shell
npm install -g gulp
```
and then:
```shell
npm install --save-dev gulp
```
and then:
```shell
npm install
```
Now, all requirements meet. so just run the server in shell by typing:
```shell
gulp
```
the server will start automaticly.
